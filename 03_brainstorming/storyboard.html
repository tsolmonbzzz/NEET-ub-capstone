  ### User experience storyboard

  

  <p>
    1. Outer insulation is on the truck
When moved to the cart, the brick loses heat. 
Bricks can stay longer in the truck, but families need to pick up their bricks quickly. Thus, coordinating the time to pick up the brick and deliver the brick will bring logistical difficulties.
Trucks need to reach the gers as close as possible when transporting to lose least heat. Door to door delivery system reaches the ger from the truck to the ger directly.
Water cart still would need some modifications to fit/keep the bricks.
2. Outer insulation is on the cart
Cart would stay at the distribution point since the cart is more expensive. Also, if the bricks stay insulated at the distribution points with the cart until families pick up the brick, heat loss will be less. 
Vertical cart with step-down pulley lifting mechanism. Vertical carts would go inside the ger, which brings difficulty in going through the door and near the stove.
3. Outer insulation is on the brick
Outer insulation being locally on the truck provides least heat loss and flexibility in storing the hot brick. 

In each case, there needs to be a minimum amount of insulation directly on the brick to avoid accidental burns and temperature control.



Stories:

Story 1.

Outer insulation on the truck, little modification on the cart, and sliding support for the brick

-A ger resident communicates with the truck driver to schedule the time for picking up the brick in door to door delivery. Door to door delivery does not promise exact time because of the undeterministic nature of the Ulaanbaatar traffic jam.
-In the case of putting the bricks in the community central distribution points. The distribution point needs to be a space with insulation and a coordinator.
-A ger resident takes out the cold brick with their hands, and places it inside the cart with the support of a sliding track.
-A ger resident will bring their own water cart along with the sliding supports and the cold brick to where the truck is parked.
-Truck driver/transporter would wear fireproof gloves and place the brick inside the ger residentâ€™s cart. Even in a door to door delivery system, there would be some amount of travel of the brick that would benefit from the cart.
-The ger resident have to be careful to not touch the brick for a longer time.
-Using a lifting mechanism, the ger resident places the brick inside the stove opening on the top.


Story 2. 

Outer insulation on the cart, fancier cart that is vertical and narrow with leg pressing pulley mechanism for lifting the plate on the other side.

-A transporter truck driver brings the bricks to the community distribution center.
-A ger resident goes to the community distribution center to pick get a cart with the hot brick. 
-The ger resident should be tall enough (children are not suited) to comfortably move the vertical hand truck.
-The ger resident first removes the cold brick from the stove with their hands since the hot brick is sitting on the cart already.
-The ger resident comes home and brings the hand truck inside the ger, near the stove, takes out the detachable insulation in the hand truck and using the help of the leg, brings the brick inside the stove from the top opening. 
-The ger resident brings back the cart with the cold brick back to the distribution center. 
-The ger resident goes home or work.
-When the ger resident comes home, it would have been such a hassle to go to the distribution center twice.

-In the case the ger resident owns the fancy hand truck, the ger resident would be able to use the hand truck for removing the cold brick and the commute time would be twice as little.
-The insulation on the cart is not used as much when the ger resident owns the hand truck.

Story 3.

Outer insulation on the brick, regular water cart, and small lifting hand device

-A truck driver brings the bricks to the community distribution center.
-A truck driver/distribution center worker brings the bricks down. They would also have the same hand device for lifting the bricks
-The ger resident comes to the distribution center with the cart and the cold brick
-The ger resident picks up the brick
-The ger resident comes home
-Using the handheld lifter, the ger resident picks up the brick and comes at the stove and places the brick inside the stove from the top opening.
