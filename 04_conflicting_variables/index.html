  ### Week 4: Conflicting variables and Resolutions

  <p>
    Conflicting variables:
    <dl>
      <dt>Brick shape and brick cost</dt>
  <dd>-Complicated shape adds manufacturing cost to the brick.
    Although, cylindrical shape may fit inside the stove better and spherical shape can have the least surface area to volume ratio, these complicated shapes add more manufacturing cost compared to rectangular box.
  More unconventional design like wok shaped brick as well falls into more expensive to manufacture shape
</dd>
  <dt>Brick size and brick cost</dt>
  <dd>-Small modular bricks can be attractive design because of its lighter weight for one module for transportation
    and can be used for controlled heat release inside the ger when it is added one by one to the stove.
    However, small modular bricks would still require insulation when seating inside the ger when the modules should not release heat.
    Also, small modules would require more steel, and hence adds more cost. And small modules would lose heat more quickly compared to one big volume of molten salt brick.
