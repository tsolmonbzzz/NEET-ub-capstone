  ### Week 5: Design desicions

  <p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Local insulation is needed for the molten salt brick regardless of its shape, design, and size</dt>
      <dd>- In the process of delivering the brick and keeping the brick inside the ger for its heat release,
        local insulation on the brick is needed to not lose the heat during the transportation and control the heat release inside the ger as well.
        This is further confirmed by the experiment 1 results, where the heat release of non-insulated brick was too quick and too much to use for ger heating.</dd>
      <dt>Brick delivering cart/hand truck with brick lifting mechanism is chosen for brick delivery and lifting</dt>
      <dd>-We chose to have a cart/hand truck that allows transporting the heavy brick in uneven terrain and can also enter inside the ger and lift the brick for loading and unloading the brick in the stove</dt>
