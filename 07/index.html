  ### Week 7: Midterm design review

  <p>
    Midterm design review reflections:</n>

    Refining the design for the multi-layer insulation is needed. We could
    start making our prototypes with mesh materials, rockwool, and insulating firebricks.</n>
    Stainless steel - </n>
    Phase changing material plateau - </n>
    Molten salt - sizzled, and decomposing temperature was around 560C </n>
    Solidification is not uniform - there could be temperature gradient in solid/liquid phases</n>
    Phsae change temperature can be spread out ~10C </n>
    Time scale -

    <ul>
    <li>Scoping of the problem/scalability - We are not concerned about the scalability.

    We are focused on proof of concept.</li>
    <li>
      When burning coal in the ger, there is heat lost through chimney, which could be significant.
      In the calculations from last year, we assumed all of the heat burnt
