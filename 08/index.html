  ### Week 8: Next steps and experiment plans

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>See if the molten salt is going though the phase change</li>
      <li>Insulation - moving the brick further from the aluminium</li>
    </ul>

    Experiment #3
    <ul>
      <li>Experiment #3 was conducted with insulation cap made by rockwool
        without metal rod support structure to avoid head conduction and
        loss through the metal rod</li>
        <li>
    </ul>
    Insulation corner piece from firebrick
    <ul>
      <li>We tested 2 different types of firebricks for our potential use of
        corner piece for multi-layer insulation with corner piece and mesh idea
        from midterm design review.
      </li>
      <li>Lighter and less dense insulation brick was very brittle when
        drilling hole test has conducted. We also conducted the experiment dropping down the firebrick piece to the ground.
        Firebrick has cracked into pieces when dropping from 16inch height.
      </li>
      <li>High density firebrick was more durable when tested with drilling hole experiment.
        However, our proposed design was difficult to make, which required complicated cutting restriction on the corner.
        A corner cutout was not easy.</li>
        <li>Instead of a 3-perpendicular-sided corner cut, 2-perpendicular-sided corner pieces
          were easier to make cut.</li>
          <li>We can use a different cut for corner piece and make design adjustments.</li>
    </ul>
    Further Design considerations for multi-layer insulation
    <ul>
      <li>There are twp types </li>
      </ul>
